## End Notes :

Throughout this project, I aimed to create a near-perfect replica of the original website by meticulously implementing its features and functionalities. This constructive experience has not only helped me gain confidence, but has also imparted valuable lessons that I can apply in real-world scenarios. As a result, I have successfully integrated most of the website's features and functionalities into my project.
